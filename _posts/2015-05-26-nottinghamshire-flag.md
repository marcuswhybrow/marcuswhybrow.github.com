My secondary school redesigned it's logo from student submissions. The winner, it was unanimously agreed, was terrible. Of course it was.

The tersest critique of this flag is flaginstitute.org's own guide to creating community flags rendering Joe Pasquale & Andy Whittaker holding it backwards.

At a distance (and at small scale) Robin's weaponry evaporates transmogrifying the legendary hero into a gesticulating amputee; a better symbol perhaps? a metaphor?

Democracy doesn't iterate. Voting only determines a comparative better, and not the "best" flag. The best flag hasn't yet arrived in the mind of a designer. A designer who must now face popular opposition to the job we trained them for.

What I learnt from a school competition also applies here: organisations that prioritise majority opinions over truth in matters of fact or principle are flawed, and inevitably this permeates everything they do.

Conversely design principles could be seen as an obfuscation. Maybe this flag truly represents democracy; including it's contemporary shortcomings.
